# GTNR
Gabe-The-Needy-Robot is a Python 3-based (text) game about randomness &amp; keeping Gabe's health balanced.

The developer, Gabriel // ItsGJK, works hard on pushing out constant updates for GTNR. 
I hope that soon this game will have better graphics, will (hopefully) be rewritten in a different and more universal language, and so much more

Q: Why start on version 0.321a?

A: I've been working on this project and sharing it with my classmates through Google Drive, however I'm now making the code more public and posting it on GitHub. I feel like the version name suits the current state of the game and I will not go back to v0.1 or similar.

# What's new in v0.321a:
*Uploaded to GitHub! Polished everything, is ready for a public release. Next version will be beta.*
