# GTNR
Gabe-The-Needy-Robot is a Python 3-based (text) game about randomness &amp; keeping Gabe's health balanced.

The developer, Gabriel // ItsGJK, works hard on pushing out constant updates for GTNR. 
I hope that soon this game will have better graphics, will (hopefully) be rewritten in a different and more universal language, and so much more

Q: Why start on version 0.321a?

A: I've been working on this project and sharing it with my classmates through Google Drive, however I'm now making the code more public and posting it on GitHub. I feel like the version name suits the current state of the game and I will not revert back to the start of versions.

# What's new in v0.4:
I've balanced all of Gabe's stats. Honestly, who gets sick as often as he does?

 - Sickness isn't that annoying, but beware! Gabe's gonna get hungry. Tired. Sad.
 
Play the game and leave some feedback on the balance! Every statistic should be equal.
